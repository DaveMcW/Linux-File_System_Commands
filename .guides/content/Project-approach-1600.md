## Creating a basic web development directory structure

### A basic web development directory structure?
In order to provide you a more real approach of the use of the CLI, we will create a web project file structure, in other words: _files that can be read by a web browser_.

__We are not going to dive into the theory of web-development__ as it is out of the scope of this course.

In its purest form, a web-development project can consist of a single `index.html` file. However, for this CLI unit we are going to be creating a slightly more elaborate website structure, which includes styles and images.

### Is this the most common approach that web-developers take?

Indeed. In fact, a vast majority of web-developers use the tools that you are about to learn for _kickstarting_ their web-projects and web-apps file and directory structure.
