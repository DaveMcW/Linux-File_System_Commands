## My terminal is full of text, how do I make some space?

As more commands are input into the prompt, the available space between the bottom of the terminal and the prompt becomes narrower.

### Show me some terminal screen clearing techniques:

### Command: `clear`
__Definition:__ The `clear` command enables more empty space in the terminal window by taking the visible content to the top. 

__The `clear` command does not erase content__

### Any other option for clearing my command line?

In fact, there is a more practical alternative.

On your keyboard, type the following keys combination:

```
ctrl + l
```

This keyboard shortcut also clears your terminal window but no prompt input is needed. How cool is that?
