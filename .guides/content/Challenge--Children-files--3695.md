## Our web project needs files

|||challenge
Lets test your file creation skills. 

Make sure you are on the `~/workspace` directory and execute: 

```
bashtest touch-test
```

__NOTE:__ Some keyboard shortcuts may not work during the CLI challenges as they run in an interactive screen.

### Some files are not being displayed on the file tree after the challenge was passed

Don't worry. If this happens: 

1. Make sure that the `ls` command actually lists the files and directories inside your _test-website/_ directory
2. If the files exist, go to Codio's top bar and do: 

__*Project > Resync File Tree*__

You should be seeing the files on the file tree now.
